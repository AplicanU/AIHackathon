# Zenith Care
Encode AI Hackathon

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the Encode AI Hackathon. It is an AI chatbot tool aimed at improving communication between A&E visitors and healthcare professionals. By enabling patients to present their case with precise, succinct data, we're streamlining decision-making for safer, more effective care.

## Technical Details
- **Stack**: Python, Healthily API, Chainlit
- **File Structure**:
  - `healthily.py`: Healthily API methods.
  - `utils.py`: Contains utility functions.
  - `layout.py`: Contains the frontend code and connects UI with the backend.
  - Frontend assets:
    - `favicon.png`
    - `logo_light.png`
    - `user_icon.png`
  - `requirements.txt`: Contains the requirements required to be installed in the environment to successfully run the application.

## Functionality
The application provides a user interaction flow, where users enter information based on the chatbot questions. These answers are then used to generate a consultation report which can be downloaded as a .pdf file to be used as a reference document at the A&E centers.
